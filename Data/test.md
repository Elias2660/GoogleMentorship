Playing the Numbers Game: R0January 30, 2020










Share this article

























First things first. What is R0 ? 
In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number is abbreviated as R0 (pronounced like “R naught”). R0 is the number which describes numerically how an epidemic is expanding or contracting.  Grossly oversimplifying, R0 is the number of people each infected person subsequently infects. When an R0=1, there is one additional case per each identified case and the outbreak is staying steady. If the R0 is >1, the outbreak is expanding. An R0 of <1 indicates that the outbreak is declining (CDC) .
There are many factors which can affect the R0. Not every patient will infect the same number of new individuals, thus the R0 is an average across all cases. Some of the factors:

Reservoir. We believe that 2019-nCoV is transmitted in at least two ways: by contact with a reservoir or by person-to-person spread. It has been suggested that the 2019-nCoV is transmitted by bats to a secondary (likely mammalian) reservoir, and from there to humans, but this has not yet been confirmed.  Until we know the reservoir, we cannot accurately calculate an R0 for cases acquired directly from infected reservoirs (though we will be able to do so for disease acquired through person-to-person transmission).


Mode of transmission. Airborne infections like measles often have very high R0 (12-18) while infections that require sexual contact like HIV have a lower R0 (2-5).


Length of time of asymptomatic infectivity. HIV is a good example here. Infected persons are often asymptomatic for 5-10 years. During this time, they may have sex with multiple people. However, not every sexual interaction would result in a transmission of virus, which is why the R0 of HIV is relatively low.


Length of time of symptomatic infectivity. Pertussis, like measles, has an R0 value of 12-17, despite being transmitted via respiratory droplets rather than by droplet nuclei. This is likely due to the very prolonged nature of its associated cough. While those afflicted by the disease might be convinced to isolate themselves initially, to don a procedural mask, or to practice cough etiquette, these measures are difficult to sustain for several weeks.


Percent of population susceptible to infection. This can be affected by several things. Immunizing individuals against disease decreases the number of susceptible individuals in a population. Haemophilus influenza B is a great example, and as immunization coverage approached 90 percent, cases of invasive diseased declined to almost zero. In some diseases, like Norovirus gastroenteritis, there is a genetic susceptibility. A minority of the population cannot be infected because they lack a carbohydrate moiety which allows the virus to attach.
Medical interventions. For respiratory viruses, including 2019-nCoV, wearing masks, social distancing and increased hand washing can all effect changes in R0.

Do we know the R0 for the 2019-NCoV?
Simply put, no. Although Dr. Tony Fauci, director of the NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), remarked that preliminary reports indicate an R0 ranging from 1.5 to 3.5 (HHS.gov), the R0 is unknown for the 2019 novel coronavirus. Current estimates are based on reported cases and it’s possible that there are more cases than have been confirmed. Additionally, with some infections there can be mild illness or asymptomatic. These are often missed early in epidemics and lead to underestimating the R0.
Furthermore, in a recently released manuscript that has not yet been peer-reviewed, the R0 is estimated using two calculation methods. Both methods yielded an R0=2.9 with the lower end of both 95 percent confidence intervals at 2.3. Additionally, they report an average incubation period of 4.8 days (J. H. Tao Liu). For comparison, the R0 of SARS in 2003 was calculated at approximately 1.8 in the early stages of the outbreak, eventually ranging between 1.1-4.2depending on which calculation method was used (Bauch).  And, as was mentioned above, the R0 can vary widely depending on many factors. For example, the R0 estimates of some common and historic diseases are:
Measles, 12-18
HIV, 2-5
Ebola, 1.5 – 2.5
1918 Flu, 2-3
Moreover, It is important to note that historic estimates of R0 may be based on data obtained from long ago, and re-calculation in today’s environment may produce different results (Delamater PL).
How can we lower the transmission risk?
With respiratory viruses, including the flu and the 2019 novel Coronavirus, frequent hand-washing and social distancing are likely the best methods to stay healthy. There is conflicting data on whether masks are helpful for preventing seasonal flu in the healthcare setting, and it’s even less clear whether they are helpful in a community setting. However, research indicating detectable coronavirus on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) after 4 hours (Casanova, Rutala and Sobsey) suggest that the careful donning and doffing of PPE is imperative in reducing the transmission of such viruses.
It’s worth noting that early in the course of the 2019-nCoV, it was thought this was a point-source, zoonotic outbreak associated with a fresh seafood market in Wuhan. Point source and zoonotic outbreaks typically have very limited person-to-person spread, thus the R0=0. Unfortunately, it is now clear that this novel coronavirus is passed from person to person. Once a serologic test is developed and accurate estimates of asymptomatic and mildly ill individuals can be made, more accurate estimates of R0 can be calculated.

This raises the question, is elimination of HIV infection in the nation feasible in the foreseeable future? We demonstrate that if the HIV transmission rate were reduced by 50%, then the reproductive rate of HIV infection would drop below unity and lead to eventual elimination of infection. In recent congressional testimony, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others asserted that the HIV transmission rate can be halved by 2020, if not earlier, provided sufficient investment is made toward achieving this goal. We assert that if adequate investment is made and the transmission rate is in fact lowered by 50%, then the HIV reproductive rate would fall below unity, setting the stage for eventual elimination of HIV infection in the U.S.On September 16, 2008, both the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and this author testified under oath before the House of Representative's Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that the transmission rate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the U.S. could be reduced by 50% in the foreseeable future. The transmission rate [T(x)] is defined as the number of HIV transmissions to HIV-seronegative partners of 100 people living with HIV in a given year x, and is calculated as 100 times the HIV incidence in year x divided by prevalence in that year.1–4 The two sets of testimony differed slightly in terms of the financial and temporal resources needed to achieve the reduction of 50% in T(x), but both agreed that halving the transmission rate was possible at least by 2020.1–3CDC's testimony listed a wide variety of HIV-prevention interventions, research and evaluation projects, and surveillance activities needed to achieve a reduction of one-half in the transmission rate. CDC's assertion that this level of reduction could occur was based on expert judgment, but was not based on a quantitative model linking investment levels to service delivery to anticipated outcomes.2,3 This author's own testimony asserted that a reduction of 50% in the transmission rate could occur in five years. This estimate was based on a mathematical model that estimated reductions in transmission rates and incidence, given specified investment levels and intervention effect sizes published in the scientific literature for a variety of HIV-prevention interventions.1 This modeling exercise emphasized the need for an HIV information and awareness campaign coupled with very substantial HIV counseling and testing expansion as soon as possible. These earliest efforts would be followed by major expansions of evidence-based HIV-prevention interventions for people living with HIV, and science-based prevention programs for people who are seronegative but at heightened risk of infection.1POLICY QUESTION: IS ELIMINATION OF HIV INFECTION FEASIBLE?The HIV transmission rate in the U.S. in 2006 was a little less than 5.0 (meaning there were approximately five HIV transmissions that year for every 100 individuals living with HIV, and at least 95% of people living with HIV in that year did not transmit HIV to a seronegative partner).4 If indeed the transmission rate were reduced to 2.5 in the coming years (with appropriate investment),1–3 then the next question is, could such a 50% reduction in the transmission rate lead to the elimination of HIV infection in the U.S.? A well-recognized definition of “elimination of infection” is as follows: “reduction to zero of the incidence of infection caused by a specific agent in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate efforts; continued measures to prevent reestablishment of transmission are required.”5TRANSMISSION RATE, REPRODUCTIVE RATE, AND INFECTION ELIMINATIONOf course, if the transmission rate could be reduced to zero, then this definition of elimination of infection obviously would be met in the short term. However, a non-zero transmission rate in the present could eventually lead to elimination of infection if the reproductive rate were to drop below one. May and Anderson have defined the basic HIV reproductive rate (R0) as follows: the number of HIV transmissions from one person living with HIV to HIV-seronegative partners over the HIV-seropositive person's lifetime. The reproductive rate is the product of three main factors: the number of HIV-seronegative partners that someone living with HIV has in a given time period, the probability of passing the virus to a given partner in that time period, and the duration (number of time periods) of infectiousness.May and Anderson rightly note that if the reproductive rate eventually drops below one—meaning there is less than one infection per every person living with HIV over the course of that person's lifetime—then eventually (perhaps over a very long time period) the epidemic will cease, as new infections become more and more rare.6,7As defined previously, the transmission rate, T(x), functions as an annualized reproductive rate. In other words, T(x) captures the numbers of partnerships and probability of transmission within a given partnership in the incidence numerator. However, because T(x) is focused on a given year x, it does not incorporate consideration of duration of infectiousness (D). The relationship between T(x) and R0 may be expressed as follows:
T(x)/100 is the expected number of HIV transmissions from each individual living with HIV in year x. The statistical expectation is that if this level of transmission would continue for D years, there would be (T(x)/100) * D transmissions; and this is the very definition of R0. For instance, if T(x) is 5.0, and the average survival with HIV post-infection was, for example, 15 years, then R0 would be 0.75; if the average survival, D, were 30 years, R0 would be 1.5. Of course, there is the complicating factor that the duration of infectiousness may be less than life expectancy, depending on the course of the disease and treatment. In this model, we assume that any variation in transmissibility due to natural history of disease or treatment is captured in T(x), and D is the number of time periods at the T(x) level of transmissibility.REPRODUCTIVE RATE ESTIMATION FOR THE U.S.Because we have available estimates of T(x) in the U.S.,4 we only need to identify a plausible estimate of D to calculate R0 for the U.S. and determine if it is more or less than unity (again, if R0 is less than one, eventually the epidemic will contract toward elimination). CDC has provided estimates of the number of new HIV infections that occur among broad age groups in the U.S.8 If we accept these estimates, assume that very few infections occur beyond 85 years of age, and take the midpoint of CDC's age ranges, we can calculate a mean age of infection in the U.S. of about 34.2 years. A major study of survival of people with HIV and on treatment in high-income countries estimated that at age 35, life expectancy is approximately 37.3 years.9 A study of two HIV-seropositive cohorts in British Columbia estimated that for injection drug users living with HIV and not on treatment, life expectancy is about 19.1 years.10CDC has estimated that approximately 21% of people living with HIV are unaware of their serostatus.11 It has also been estimated that among people living with HIV who are aware of their serostatus, roughly a third are not on treatment.12 This implies an effective percentage (52.9%) of people living with HIV who are on treatment. We, therefore, estimate the life expectancy after infection in the U.S. to be roughly 28.73 years [(37.3 * 0.529) + (19.1 * 0.471)]. If everyone were on treatment, we would estimate the life expectancy to be simply 37.30 years.In its 2001–2005 strategic HIV-prevention plan, CDC aimed to achieve a treatment level of 80%; in its interim plan through 2010, CDC has lowered its expectations to a target treatment level of 65%. These two target treatment levels would imply life expectancies of 33.66 and 30.93 years, respectively. As noted previously, we make the simplifying assumption that life expectancy with HIV is an estimate of D because we assume that any variation in transmissibility due to natural history of disease or treatment is captured in T(x), and D is the number of time periods at the T(x) level of transmissibility.The Table displays calculated values for R0 at a variety of T(x) levels and four levels of life expectancy: 28.73, 30.93, 33.66, and 37.30 years. The Table also includes several other levels of life expectancy so one can readily see how R0 changes from a low life expectancy of 15.00 years up to 40.00 years. Indeed, if T(x) could be driven down to 2.5 (as may be feasible with the proper investment according to the September 2008 congressional hearing testimony), then R0 would drop below one and eventually the epidemic would move toward elimination of infection.TableCalculated HIV reproductive rate at various transmission rates and levels of years of post-infection life expectancy, United StatesOpen in a separate windowHIV = human immunodeficiency virusD = duration of infectiousness (levels of years of post-infection life expectancy)T(x) = transmission rateR0 = reproductive rateThe Table also displays the threshold values for T(x) at which R0 equals unity at any of the scenarios for D. The thresholds for T(x) were calculated by using the Goal Seek function in Microsoft® Excel.13 We see that the necessary level of T(x) to achieve an R0 of unity is never more than 3.5 and never less than 2.6 under the four main scenario levels for D.DISCUSSIONThe primary point of this analysis is that if R0 drops below unity, elimination of infection will eventually follow (though elimination might occur quite some distant years in the future). For the U.S., if the transmission rate can be reduced by 50% from 2006 levels, then R0 would appear to fall below unity. Two independent estimates have suggested that achieving a reduction of one-half in the transmission rate is possible with currently available types of interventions by 2020, if not earlier, provided that the investment in HIV prevention in the U.S. is suitable.1–3 Therefore, using this logic, elimination of HIV infection in the U.S. could well be in our future (even if a rather distant future), provided that we as a nation make the choice to invest the requisite resources recently described to Congress.LimitationsOf course, these analyses were subject to some limitations, as are any mathematical modeling exercises. As an example, Granich et al. recently used a complex mathematical model to examine the potential impact of universal HIV testing with immediate antiretroviral therapy (ART) on an exclusively heterosexual epidemic in South Africa14 (of course, the major mode of transmission in the U.S. epidemic is same-sex contact, and the transmission rate actually rose initially when highly active ART [HAART] became available in the U.S.4); eight editorials, as well as the authors' reply, were subsequently published pointing out limitations and controversies in the Granich et al. model.15–23 Therefore, transparency regarding model limitations is important.As to the analysis presented in this article, we note that the level of uncertainty in the calculation of T(x) is the same as that uncertainty inherent in CDC's recent extended back-calculation estimates of HIV incidence in the U.S.8 Further, experience with the natural history of HIV disease in the era of HAART is still unfolding, and current life expectancy estimates (D) contain uncertainty and may well need to be revised in the future.9,10Additionally, as more is known about how HIV treatment impacts transmissibility of the virus to seronegative partners,24 it may be that our assumption that duration of transmissibility at the T(x) level is equal to life expectancy is somehow false, and D should be set at less than life expectancy. However, employing this assumption in this model is conservative because as D becomes progressively less than life expectancy, the amount of reduction in T(x) from current levels needed to achieve an R0 of unity is accordingly lessened.CONCLUSIONThese analyses are not meant to imply that we as a nation should be patient and wait for a lengthy period of time for HIV infection to be eliminated in the U.S. Rather, these analyses are meant to suggest that if a seemingly feasible level of reduction in the HIV transmission rate can be achieved in the foreseeable future using existing prevention strategies, then in the long term, eventual elimination of HIV infection in the U.S. should follow. The speed at which this will occur is within the control of those who influence and make funding and programmatic decisions surrounding HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome programs.REFERENCES1.

Abstract
The basic reproduction number (R0), also called the basic reproduction ratio or rate or the basic reproductive rate, is an epidemiologic metric used to describe the contagiousness or transmissibility of infectious agents. R0 is affected by numerous biological, sociobehavioral, and environmental factors that govern pathogen transmission and, therefore, is usually estimated with various types of complex mathematical models, which make R0 easily misrepresented, misinterpreted, and misapplied. R0 is not a biological constant for a pathogen, a rate over time, or a measure of disease severity, and R0 cannot be modified through vaccination campaigns. R0 is rarely measured directly, and modeled R0 values are dependent on model structures and assumptions. Some R0 values reported in the scientific literature are likely obsolete. R0 must be estimated, reported, and applied with great caution because this basic metric is far from simple.



The basic reproduction number (R0), pronounced “R naught,” is intended to be an indicator of the contagiousness or transmissibility of infectious and parasitic agents. R0 is often encountered in the epidemiology and public health literature and can also be found in the popular press (1–6). R0 has been described as being one of the fundamental and most often used metrics for the study of infectious disease dynamics (7–12). An R0 for an infectious disease event is generally reported as a single numeric value or low–high range, and the interpretation is typically presented as straightforward; an outbreak is expected to continue if R0 has a value >1 and to end if R0 is <1 (13). The potential size of an outbreak or epidemic often is based on the magnitude of the R0 value for that event (10), and R0 can be used to estimate the proportion of the population that must be vaccinated to eliminate an infection from that population (14,15). R0 values have been published for measles, polio, influenza, Ebola virus disease, HIV disease, a diversity of vectorborne infectious diseases, and many other communicable diseases (14,16–18).
The concept of R0 was first introduced in the field of demography (9), where this metric was used to count offspring. When R0 was adopted for use by epidemiologists, the objects being counted were infective cases (19). Numerous definitions for R0 have been proposed. Although the basic conceptual framework is similar for each, the operational definitions are not always identical. Dietz states that R0 is “the number of secondary cases one case would produce in a completely susceptible population” (19). Fine supplements this definition with the description “average number of secondary cases” (17). Diekmann and colleagues use the description “expected number of secondary cases” and provide additional specificity to the terminology regarding a single case (13).
In the hands of experts, R0 can be a valuable concept. However, the process of defining, calculating, interpreting, and applying R0 is far from straightforward. The simplicity of an R0 value and its corresponding interpretation in relation to infectious disease dynamics masks the complicated nature of this metric. Although R0 is a biological reality, this value is usually estimated with complex mathematical models developed using various sets of assumptions. The interpretation of R0 estimates derived from different models requires an understanding of the models’ structures, inputs, and interactions. Because many researchers using R0 have not been trained in sophisticated mathematical techniques, R0 is easily subject to misrepresentation, misinterpretation, and misapplication. Notable examples include incorrectly defining R0 (1) and misinterpreting the effects of vaccination on R0 (3). Further, many past lessons regarding this metric appear to have been lost or overlooked over time. Therefore, a review of the concept of R0 is needed, given the increased attention this metric receives in the academic literature (20). In this article, we address misconceptions about R0 that have proliferated as this metric has become more frequently used outside of the realm of mathematical biology and theoretic epidemiology, and we recommend that R0 be applied and discussed with caution.

Variations in R0
For any given infectious agent, the scientific literature might present numerous different R0 values. Estimations of the R0 value are often calculated as a function of 3 primary parameters—the duration of contagiousness after a person becomes infected, the likelihood of infection per contact between a susceptible person and an infectious person or vector, and the contact rate—along with additional parameters that can be added to describe more complex cycles of transmission (19). Further, the epidemiologic triad (agent, host, and environmental factors) sometimes provides inspiration for adding parameters related to the availability of public health resources, the policy environment, various aspects of the built environment, and other factors that influence transmission dynamics and, thus, are relevant for the estimation of R0 values (21). Yet, even if the infectiousness of a pathogen (that is, the likelihood of infection occurring after an effective contact event has occurred) and the duration of contagiousness are biological constants, R0 will fluctuate if the rate of human–human or human–vector interactions varies over time or space. Limited evidence supports the applicability of R0 outside the region where the value was calculated (20). Any factor having the potential to influence the contact rate, including population density (e.g., rural vs. urban), social organization (e.g., integrated vs. segregated), and seasonality (e.g., wet vs. rainy season for vectorborne infections), will ultimately affect R0. Because R0 is a function of the effective contact rate, the value of R0 is a function of human social behavior and organization, as well as the innate biological characteristics of particular pathogens. More than 20 different R0 values (range 5.4–18) were reported for measles in a variety of study areas and periods (22), and a review in 2017 identified feasible measles R0 values of 3.7–203.3 (23). This wide range highlights the potential variability in the value of R0 for an infectious disease event on the basis of local sociobehavioral and environmental circumstances.


Various Names for R0
Inconsistency in the name and definition of R0 has potentially been a cause for misunderstanding the meaning of R0. R0 was originally called the basic case reproduction rate when George MacDonald introduced the concept into the epidemiology literature in the 1950s (17,19,24,25). Although MacDonald used Z0 to represent the metric, the current symbolic representation (R0) appears to have remained largely consistent since that time. However, multiple variations of the name for the concept expressed by R0 have been used in the scientific literature, including the use of basic and case as the first word in the term, reproduction and reproductive for the second word, and number, ratio, and rate for the final part of the term (13). Although the frequent use of the term basic reproduction rate is in line with MacDonald’s original terminology (9), some users interpret the use of the word rate as suggesting a quantity having a unit with a per-time dimension (7). If R0 were a rate involving time, the metric would provide information about how quickly an epidemic will spread through a population. But R0 does not indicate whether new cases will occur within 24 hours after the initial case or months later, just as R0 does not indicate whether the disease produced by the infection is severe. Instead, R0 is most accurately described in terms of cases per case (7,13). Calling R0 a rate rather than a number or ratio might create some undue confusion about what the value represents.


R0 and Vaccination Campaigns
Vaccination campaigns reduce the proportion of a population at risk for infection and have proven to be highly effective in mitigating future outbreaks (26). This conclusion is sometimes used to suggest that an aim of vaccination campaigns is to remove susceptible members of the population to reduce the R0 for the event to <1. Although the removal of susceptible members from the population will affect infection transmission by reducing the number of effective contacts between infectious and susceptible persons, this activity will technically not reduce the R0 value because the definition of R0 includes the assumption of a completely susceptible population. When examining the effect of vaccination, the more appropriate metric to use is the effective reproduction number (R), which is similar to R0 but does not assume complete susceptibility of the population and, therefore, can be estimated with populations having immune members (16,20,27). Efforts aimed at reducing the number of susceptible persons within a population through vaccination would result in a reduction of the R value, rather than R0 value. In this scenario, vaccination could potentially end an epidemic, if R can be reduced to a value <1 (16,27,28). The effective reproduction number can also be specified at a particular time t, presented as R(t) or Rt, which can be used to trace changes in R as the number of susceptible members in a population is reduced (29,30). When the goal is to measure the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns or other public health interventions, R0 is not necessarily the best metric (10,20).


Measuring and Estimating R0
Counting the number of cases of infection during an epidemic can be extremely difficult, even when public health officials use active surveillance and contact tracing to attempt to locate all infected persons. Although measuring the true R0 value is possible during an outbreak of a newly emerging infectious pathogen that is spreading through a wholly susceptible population, rarely are there sufficient data collection systems in place to capture the early stages of an outbreak when R0 might be measured most accurately. As a result, R0 is nearly always estimated retrospectively from seroepidemiologic data or by using theoretical mathematical models (31). Data-driven approaches include the use of the number of susceptible persons at endemic equilibrium, average age at infection, final size equation, and intrinsic growth rate (10). When mathematical models are used, R0 values are often estimated by using ordinary differential equations (8–10,19,31), but high-quality data are rarely available for all components of the model. The estimated values of R0 generated by mathematical models are dependent on numerous decisions made by the modeler (8,32,33). The population structure of the model, such as the susceptible-infectious-recovered model or susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, which includes compartments for persons who are exposed but not yet infectious, as well as assumptions about demographic dynamics (e.g., births, deaths, and migration over time), are critical model parameters. Population mixing and contact patterns must also be considered; for example, for homogeneous mixing, all population members are equally likely to come into contact with one another, and for heterogeneous mixing, variation in contact patterns are present among age subgroups or geographic regions. Other decisions include whether to use a deterministic (yielding the same outcomes each time the model is run) or stochastic (generating a distribution of likely outcomes on the basis of variations in the inputs) approach and which distributions (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions) to use to describe the probable values of parameters, such as effective contact rates and duration of contagiousness. Furthermore, many of the parameters included in the models used to estimate R0 are merely educated guesses; the true values are often unknown or difficult or impossible to measure directly (31,34,35). This limitation is compounded as models become more complex and, thus, require more input parameters (20,35), such as when using models to estimate the value of R0 for infectious pathogens with more complex transmission pathways, which can include vectorborne infectious agents or those with environmental or wildlife reservoirs. In summary, although only 1 true R0 value exists for an infectious disease event occurring in a particular place at a particular time, models that have minor differences in structure and assumptions might produce different estimates of that value, even when using the same epidemiologic data as inputs (20,31,32,36,37).


Obsolete R0 Values
New estimates of R0 have been produced for infectious disease events that occurred in recent history, such as the West Africa Ebola outbreak (34,38,39). However, for many vaccine-preventable diseases, the scientific literature reports R0 values calculated much further back in history. For example, the oft-reported measles R0 values of 12–18 are based on data acquired during 1912–1928 in the United States (R0 of 12.5) and 1944–1979 in England and Wales (R0 of 13.7–18.0) (14), even though more recent estimates of the R0 for measles highlight a much greater numeric range and variation across settings (23). For pertussis (R0 of 12–17), the original data sources are 1908–1917 in the United States (R0 of 12.2) and 1944–1979 in England and Wales (R0 of 14.3–17.1) (14). The major changes that have occurred in how humans organize themselves both socially and geographically make these historic values extremely unlikely to match present day epidemiologic realities. Behavioral changes undoubtedly have altered contact rates, which are a key component of R0 calculations. Yet, these R0 values have been repeated so often in the literature that newer R0 values generated by using modern data might be dismissed if they fall outside the range of previous estimates. Given that R0 is often considered when designing and implementing vaccination strategies and other public health interventions, the use of R0 values derived from older data is likely inappropriate (23). Decisions about public health practice should be made with contemporaneous R0 values or R values instead.


Conclusions
Although R0 might appear to be a simple measure that can be used to determine infectious disease transmission dynamics and the threats that new outbreaks pose to the public health, the definition, calculation, and interpretation of R0 are anything but simple. R0 remains a valuable epidemiologic concept, but the expanded use of R0 in both the scientific literature and the popular press appears to have enabled some misunderstandings to propagate. R0 is an estimate of contagiousness that is a function of human behavior and biological characteristics of pathogens. R0 is not a measure of the severity of an infectious disease or the rapidity of a pathogen’s spread through a population. R0 values are nearly always estimated from mathematical models, and the estimated values are dependent on numerous decisions made in the modeling process. The contagiousness of different historic, emerging, and reemerging infectious agents cannot be fairly compared without recalculating R0 with the same modeling assumptions. Some of the R0 values commonly reported in the literature for past epidemics might not be valid for outbreaks of the same infectious disease today.
R0 can be misrepresented, misinterpreted, and misapplied in a variety of ways that distort the metric’s true meaning and value. Because of these various sources of confusion, R0 must be applied and discussed with caution in research and practice. This epidemiologic construct will only remain valuable and relevant when used and interpreted correctly.

Abstract:The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) has set a new 90-90-90 global target for the coverage of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to be reached by 2020. This would mean that 90% of all people infected with HIV know their status, 90% of them are on ART and 90% of them will have full viral load suppression. Here we first estimate the case reproduction number, R0, for countries in sub-Saharan Africa and for India using data on the rate at which the prevalence of HIV increased at the start of the epidemic and the life expectancy of people living with HIV who are not on ART. R0 determines the magnitude of the control problem, that is to say, the extent to which transmission must be reduced to eliminate HIV. We show that in sub-Saharan Africa the median value of R0 is 4.6 and in all but five countries R0 is less than 6.3. If the 90-90-90 target is reached, 73% of all those living with HIV will have full viral load suppression. If this is maintained it should guarantee elimination in 70% of all countries in sub-Saharan Africa and will reduce R0 to less than 2 in the remaining 12 countries, making elimination easy to achieve by increasing the availability of other high impact methods of prevention.
    


 
Comments:
We have updated the previous version for two reasons. First, we have given a better approximation for the estimation of R0 from epidemic doubling times. Second, we have added comments on the new UNAIDS '90-90-90' strategy which puts the results into a broader context

Gauging Contagious InfectionsMedically reviewed by Alana Biggers, M.D., MPH — By Vanessa Bates Ramirez —  Updated on June 14, 2023MeaningCOVID-19 R0How it’s calculatedConditions it measuresPreventionR0, pronounced “R naught,” is a mathematical term that indicates how contagious an infectious disease is. It’s also referred to as the reproduction number. As an infection is transmitted to new people, it reproduces itself.R0 tells you the average number of people who will contract a contagious disease from one person with that disease. It specifically applies to a population of people who were previously free of infection and haven’t been vaccinated.For example, if a disease has an R0 of 18, a person who has the disease will transmit it to an average of 18 other people. That replication will continue if no one has been vaccinated against the disease or is already immune to it in their community.What do R0 values mean?Three possibilities exist for the potential transmission or decline of a disease, depending on its R0 value:If R0 is less than 1, each existing infection causes less than one new infection. In this case, the disease will decline and eventually die out.If R0 equals 1, each existing infection causes one new infection. The disease will stay alive and stable, but there won’t be an outbreak or an epidemic.If R0 is more than 1, each existing infection causes more than one new infection. The disease will be transmitted between people, and there may be an outbreak or epidemic.Importantly, a disease’s R0 value only applies when everyone in a population is completely vulnerable to the disease. This means:no one has been vaccinatedno one has had the disease beforethere’s no way to control the spread of the diseaseThis combination of conditions is rare nowadays thanks to advances in medicine. Many diseases that were deadly in the past can now be contained and sometimes cured.For example, in 1918 there was a worldwide outbreak of the swine flu that killed 50 million people. According to a review article published in BMC Medicine, the R0 value of the 1918 pandemic was estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.8.But when the swine flu, or H1N1 virus, came back in 2009, its R0 value was between 1.4 and 1.6, report researchers in the journal Science. The existence of vaccines and antiviral drugs made the 2009 outbreak much less deadly.COVID-19 R0The R0 for COVID-19 is a median of 5.7, according to a study published online in Emerging Infectious Diseases. That’s about double an earlier R0 estimate of 2.2 to 2.7The 5.7 means that one person with COVID-19 can potentially transmit the coronavirus to 5 to 6 people, rather than the 2 to 3 researchers originally thought.Researchers calculated the new number based on data from the original outbreak in Wuhan, China. They used parameters like the virus incubation period (4.2 days) — how much time elapsed from when people were exposed to the virus and when they started to show symptoms. The researchers estimated a doubling time of 2 to 3 days, which is much faster than earlier estimates of 6 to 7 days. The doubling time is how long it takes for the number of coronavirus cases, hospitalizations, and deaths to double. The shorter the time, the faster the disease is spreading.With an R0 of 5.7, at least 82 percent of the population needs to be immune to COVID-19 to stop its transmission through vaccination and herd immunity.The study authors say active surveillance, tracking the contacts of people who contracted the coronavirus, quarantine, and strong physical distancing measures are needed to stop the coronavirus from being transmitted.How is the R0 of a disease calculated?The following factors are taken into account to calculate the R0 of a disease:Infectious periodSome diseases are contagious for longer periods than others.For example, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), adults with the flu are typically contagious for up to 8 days. Children can be contagious for longer than that.The longer the infectious period of a disease, the more likely a person who has it can transmit the disease to other people. A long period of infectiousness will contribute to a higher R0 value.Contact rateIf a person who has with a contagious disease comes into contact with many people who aren’t infected or vaccinated, the disease will be transmitted more quickly. If that person remains at home, in a hospital, or otherwise quarantined while they’re contagious, the disease will be transmitted more slowly. A high contact rate will contribute to a higher R0 value.Mode of transmissionThe diseases that are transmitted the fastest and easiest are the ones that can travel through the air, such as the flu or measles.Physical contact with a person who has such a disease isn’t needed to transmit it. You can contract the flu from breathing near someone who has the flu, even if you never touch them.In contrast, diseases that are transmitted through bodily fluids, such as Ebola or HIV, aren’t as easy to contract or transmit. This is because you need to come into contact with infected blood, saliva, or other bodily fluids to contract them.Airborne illnesses tend to have a higher R0 value than those spread through direct contact.What conditions are measured by R0?R0 can be used to measure any contagious disease that may spread in a susceptible population. Some of the most highly contagious conditions are measles and the common flu. More serious conditions, such as Ebola and HIV, spread less easily between people.This illustration shows some commonly known diseases and their estimated R0 values.Tips for preventionR0 is a useful calculation for predicting and controlling the transmission of disease. Medical science continues to advance. Researchers are discovering new cures for different conditions, but contagious diseases aren’t going to disappear anytime soon.Take these steps to help prevent the transmission of contagious diseases:Learn how different contagious diseases are transmitted.Ask your doctor about steps you can take to stop the transmission of infection. For example, wash your hands regularly with soap and water, especially before you prepare or eat food.Stay up to date on routine vaccinations.Ask your doctor what diseases you should be vaccinated against.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Metric in epidemiology
This article is about the rate of spread of an epidemic. For the average number of offspring born to a female, see Net reproduction rate.
"R number" redirects here. For other uses, see R-value.







R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 is the average number of people infected from one other person. For example, Ebola has an 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 of two, so on average, a person who has Ebola will pass it on to two other people.
In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number, or basic reproductive number (sometimes called basic reproduction ratio or basic reproductive rate), denoted 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 (pronounced R nought or R zero),[1] of an infection is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection.[2] The definition assumes that no other individuals are infected or immunized (naturally or through vaccination). Some definitions, such as that of the Australian Department of Health, add the absence of "any deliberate intervention in disease transmission".[3] The basic reproduction number is not necessarily the same as the effective reproduction number 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 (usually written 




R

t




{\displaystyle R_{t}}

 [t for time], sometimes 




R

e




{\displaystyle R_{e}}

),[4] which is the number of cases generated in the current state of a population, which does not have to be the uninfected state. 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 is a dimensionless number (persons infected per person infecting) and not a time rate, which would have units of time−1,[5] or units of time like doubling time.[6]





R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 is not a biological constant for a pathogen as it is also affected by other factors such as environmental conditions and the behaviour of the infected population. 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 values are usually estimated from mathematical models, and the estimated values are dependent on the model used and values of other parameters. Thus values given in the literature only make sense in the given context and it is not recommended to compare values based on different models.[7] 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 does not by itself give an estimate of how fast an infection spreads in the population.
The most important uses of 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 are determining if an emerging infectious disease can spread in a population and determining what proportion of the population should be immunized through vaccination to eradicate a disease. In commonly used infection models, when 




R

0


>
1


{\displaystyle R_{0}>1}

 the infection will be able to start spreading in a population, but not if 




R

0


<
1


{\displaystyle R_{0}<1}

. Generally, the larger the value of 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

, the harder it is to control the epidemic. For simple models, the proportion of the population that needs to be effectively immunized (meaning not susceptible to infection) to prevent sustained spread of the infection has to be larger than 



1
−
1

/


R

0




{\displaystyle 1-1/R_{0}}

.[8] This is the so-called Herd immunity threshold or herd immunity level. Here, herd immunity means that the disease cannot spread in the population because each infected person, on average, can only transmit the infection to less than one other contact.[9] Conversely, the proportion of the population that remains susceptible to infection in the endemic equilibrium is 



1

/


R

0




{\displaystyle 1/R_{0}}

. However, this threshold is based on simple models that assume a fully mixed population with no structured relations between the individuals. For example, if there is some correlation between people's immunization (e.g., vaccination) status, then the formula 



1
−
1

/


R

0




{\displaystyle 1-1/R_{0}}

 may underestimate the herd immunity threshold.[9]

Graph of herd immunity threshold vs basic reproduction number with selected diseases
The basic reproduction number is affected by several factors, including the duration of infectivity of affected people, the contagiousness of the microorganism, and the number of susceptible people in the population that the infected people contact.[10]


History[edit]
The roots of the basic reproduction concept can be traced through the work of Ronald Ross, Alfred Lotka and others,[11] but its first modern application in epidemiology was by George Macdonald in 1952,[12] who constructed population models of the spread of malaria.  In his work he called the quantity basic reproduction rate and denoted it by 




Z

0




{\displaystyle Z_{0}}

.  

Overview of R0 estimation methods[edit]
Compartmental models[edit]
Main article: Compartmental models in epidemiology
Compartmental models are a general modeling technique often applied to the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. In these models, population members are assigned to 'compartments' with labels – for example, S, I, or R, (Susceptible, Infectious, or Recovered). These models can be used to estimate 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

.

Epidemic models on networks[edit]
Main article: Mathematical modelling of infectious disease
Epidemics can be modeled as diseases spreading over networks of contact and disease transmission between people.[13] Nodes in these networks represent individuals and links (edges) between nodes represent the contact or disease transmission between them. If such a network is a locally tree-like network, then the basic reproduction can be written in terms of the average excess degree of the transmission network such that:





R

0


=



⟨

k

2


⟩


⟨
k
⟩



−
1
,


{\displaystyle R_{0}={\frac {\langle k^{2}\rangle }{\langle k\rangle }}-1,}


where 




⟨
k
⟩



{\displaystyle {\langle k\rangle }}

 is the mean-degree (average degree) of the network and 




⟨

k

2


⟩



{\displaystyle {\langle k^{2}\rangle }}

 is the second moment of the transmission network degree distribution. 

Heterogeneous populations[edit]
In populations that are not homogeneous, the definition of 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 is more subtle. The definition must account for the fact that a typical infected individual may not be an average individual. As an extreme example, consider a population in which a small portion of the individuals mix fully with one another while the remaining individuals are all isolated. A disease may be able to spread in the fully mixed portion even though a randomly selected individual would lead to fewer than one secondary case. This is because the typical infected individual is in the fully mixed portion and thus is able to successfully cause infections. In general, if the individuals infected early in an epidemic are on average either more likely or less likely to transmit the infection than individuals infected late in the epidemic, then the computation of 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 must account for this difference. An appropriate definition for 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 in this case is "the expected number of secondary cases produced, in a completely susceptible population, produced by a typical infected individual".[14]
The basic reproduction number can be computed as a ratio of known rates over time: if a  contagious individual contacts 



β


{\displaystyle \beta }

 other people per unit time, if all of those people are assumed to contract the disease, and if the disease has a mean infectious period of 






1
γ





{\displaystyle {\dfrac {1}{\gamma }}}

, then the basic reproduction number is just 




R

0


=



β
γ





{\displaystyle R_{0}={\dfrac {\beta }{\gamma }}}

.  Some diseases have multiple possible latency periods, in which case the reproduction number for the disease overall is the sum of the reproduction number for each transition time into the disease.

Effective reproduction number[edit]
An explanation of the 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 number in simple terms from the Welsh Government.
In reality, varying proportions of the population are immune to any given disease at any given time. To account for this, the effective reproduction number 




R

e




{\displaystyle R_{e}}

 or 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 is used. 




R

t




{\displaystyle R_{t}}

 is the average number of new infections caused by a single infected individual at time t in the partially susceptible population. It can be found by multiplying 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 by the fraction S of the population that is susceptible. When the fraction of the population that is immune increases (i. e. the susceptible population S decreases) so much that 




R

e




{\displaystyle R_{e}}

 drops below 1 in a basic SIR simulation, "herd immunity" has been achieved and the number of cases occurring in the population will gradually decrease to zero.[15][16][17]

Limitations of R0[edit]
Use of 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 in the popular press has led to misunderstandings and distortions of its meaning. 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 can be calculated from many different mathematical models. Each of these can give a different estimate of 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

, which needs to be interpreted in the context of that model.[10] Therefore, the contagiousness of different infectious agents cannot be compared without recalculating 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 with invariant assumptions.

 values for past outbreaks might not be valid for current outbreaks of the same disease. Generally speaking, 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 can be used as a threshold, even if calculated with different methods: if 




R

0


<
1


{\displaystyle R_{0}<1}

, the outbreak will die out, and if 




R

0


>
1


{\displaystyle R_{0}>1}

, the outbreak will expand. In some cases, for some models, values of 




R

0


<
1


{\displaystyle R_{0}<1}

 can still lead to self-perpetuating outbreaks. This is particularly problematic if there are intermediate vectors between hosts (as is the case for zoonoses), such as malaria.[18] Therefore, comparisons between values from the "Values of 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 of well-known contagious diseases" table should be conducted with caution.
Although 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 cannot be modified through vaccination or other changes in population susceptibility, it can vary based on a number of biological, sociobehavioral, and environmental factors.[7] It can also be modified by physical distancing and other public policy or social interventions,[19][7] although some historical definitions exclude any deliberate intervention in reducing disease transmission, including nonpharmacological interventions.[3] And indeed, whether nonpharmacological interventions are included in 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 often depends on the paper, disease, and what if any intervention is being studied.[7] This creates some confusion, because 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 is not a constant; whereas most mathematical parameters with "nought" subscripts are constants.




R


{\displaystyle R}

 depends on many factors, many of which need to be estimated. Each of these factors adds to uncertainty in estimates of 



R


{\displaystyle R}

. Many of these factors are not important for informing public policy. Therefore, public policy may be better served by metrics similar to 



R


{\displaystyle R}

, but which are more straightforward to estimate, such as doubling time or  half-life (




t

1

/

2




{\displaystyle t_{1/2}}

).[20][21]
Methods used to calculate 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 include the survival function, rearranging the largest eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix, the next-generation method,[22] calculations from the intrinsic growth rate,[23] existence of the endemic equilibrium, the number of susceptibles at the endemic equilibrium, the average age of infection[24] and the final size equation.[25] Few of these methods agree with one another, even when starting with the same system of differential equations.[18] Even fewer actually calculate the average number of secondary infections. Since 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 is rarely observed in the field and is usually calculated via a mathematical model, this severely limits its usefulness.[26]

Sample values for various contagious diseases[edit]
Despite the difficulties in estimating 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

mentioned in the previous section, estimates have been made for a number of genera, and are shown in this table. Each genus may be composed of many species, strains, or variants. Estimations of 




R

0




{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 for species, strains, and variants are typically less accurate than for genera, and so are provided in separate tables below for diseases of particular interest (influenza and COVID-19).

^ a b c Calculated using p = 1 − 1/R0.

^ a b From a module of a training course[31] with data modified from other sources.[32][33][34]

^ a b c When R0 < 1.0, the disease naturally disappears.



Compartmental models in epidemiology describe disease dynamics over time in a population of susceptible (S), infectious (I), and recovered (R) people using the SIR model. Note that in the SIR model, 



R
(

{\displaystyle R(0)}

 and

{\displaystyle R_{0}}

 are different quantities – the former describes the number of recovered at t = 0 whereas the latter describes the ratio between the frequency of contacts to the frequency of recovery.
Held L, Hens N, O'Neill PD, Wallinga J (November 7, 2019). Handbook of Infectious Disease Data Analysis. CRC Press. p. 347. ISBN 978-1-351-83932-7. According to Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, "The effective reproductive number (R or Re is more commonly used to describe transmissibility, which is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by per [sic] infectious case." For example, by one preliminary estimate during the ongoing pandemic, the effective reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 was found to be 2.9,[citation needed] whereas for SARS it was 1.77.

        Abstract
        
      



          Context:
        
      
      In HIV-infected patients having virologic suppression (plasma HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) with antiretroviral therapy, intermittent episodes of low-level viremia have been correlated with slower decay rates of latently infected cells and increased levels of viral evolution, but the clinical significance of these episodes is unknown.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine if HIV-infected patients with intermittent viremia have a higher risk of virologic failure (confirmed HIV RNA >200 copies/mL).
    


          Design and setting:
        
      
      Retrospective analysis of subjects in well-characterized cohorts, the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 343 trial of induction-maintenance therapy (August 1997 to November 1998) and the Merck 035 trial (ongoing since March 1995).
    


          Patients:
        
      
      Two hundred forty-one ACTG 343 patients, of whom 101 received triple-drug therapy throughout the study, and a small group of 13 patients from Merck 035 having virologic suppression after 6 months of indinavir-zidovudine-lamivudine.
    


          Main outcome measures:
        
      
      Association of intermittent viremia (plasma HIV RNA >50 copies/mL with a subsequent measure <50 copies/mL) with virologic failure (2 consecutive plasma HIV RNA measures >200 copies/mL) in both study groups; evidence of drug resistance in 7 patients from the small (n = 13) study group with long-term follow-up.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Intermittent viremia occurred in 96 (40%) of the 241 ACTG 343 patients of whom 32 (13%) had 2 consecutive HIV RNA values >50 copies/mL during the median 84 weeks of observation (median duration of observation after first intermittent viremia episode was 46 weeks). Of the 101 individuals receiving triple-drug therapy throughout, 29% had intermittent viremia; the proportion of episodes occurring during the maintenance period was 64% for the entire cohort and 68% for the group not receiving triple-drug therapy throughout vs 55% for those who did (P =.25). Intermittent viremia did not predict virologic failure: 10 (10.4%) of 96 patients with and 20 (13.8%) of 145 patients without intermittent viremia had virologic failure (relative risk, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-1.72). In a Cox proportional hazards model, the risk for virologic failure was not significantly greater in the ACTG 343 patients with intermittent viremia (hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.59-2.79). Median viral load in 10 ACTG 343 patients assessed between 24 and 60 weeks of therapy using an ultrasensitive 2.5-copies/mL detection level assay was 23 copies/mL in those with intermittent viremia vs <2.5 copies/mL in those without (P =.15). Intermittent viremia occurred in 6 of 13 patients from the small study group assessed after 76 to 260 weeks of therapy (using the 2.5-copies/mL detection level assay) and was associated with a higher steady state of viral replication (P =.03), but not virologic failure over 4.5 years of observation. Viral DNA sequences from 7 patients did not show evolution of drug resistance.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Intermittent viremia occurred frequently and was associated with higher levels of replication (Merck 035), but was not associated with virologic failure in patients receiving initial combination therapy of indinavir-zidovudine-lamivudine (ACTG 343 and Merck 035). In this population, treatment changes may not be necessary to maintain long-term virologic suppression with low-level or intermittent viremia.

        Abstract
        
      


      
      Current combination antiretroviral therapies (ARV) are widely used to treat HIV. However drug-resistant strains of HIV have quickly evolved, and the level of risky behaviour has increased in certain communities. Hence, currently the overall impact that ARV will have on HIV epidemics remains unclear. We have used a mathematical model to predict whether the current therapies: are reducing the severity of HIV epidemics, and could even lead to eradication of a high-prevalence (30%) epidemic. We quantified the epidemic-level impact of ARV on reducing epidemic severity by deriving the basic reproduction number (R(0)(ARV)). R(0)(ARV) specifies the average number of new infections that one HIV case generates during his lifetime when ARV is available and ARV-resistant strains can evolve and be transmitted; if R(0)(ARV) is less than one epidemic eradication is possible. We estimated for the HIV epidemic in the San Francisco gay community (using uncertainty analysis), the present day value of R(0)(ARV), and the probability of epidemic eradication. We assumed a high usage of ARV and three behavioural assumptions: that risky sex would (1) decrease, (2) remain stable, or (3) increase. Our estimated values of R(0)(ARV) (median and interquartile range [IQR]) were: 0.90 (0.85-0.96) if risky sex decreases, 1.0 (0.94-1.05) if risky sex remains stable, and 1.16 (1.05-1.28) if risky sex increases. R(0)(ARV) decreased as the fraction of cases receiving treatment increased. The probability of epidemic eradication is high (p=0.85) if risky sex decreases, moderate (p=0.5) if levels of risky sex remain stable, and low (p=0.13) if risky sex increases. We conclude that ARV can function as an effective HIV-prevention tool, even with high levels of drug resistance and risky sex. Furthermore, even a high-prevalence HIV epidemic could be eradicated using current ARV.
