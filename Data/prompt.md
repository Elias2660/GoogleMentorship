Write as an output no more words than specified. In total, there should be at most four lines out. The first one should have two numbers, separated with a comma; the next should have a URL, and the next should either be blank or have a URL. 

Write the average R0 value of the HIV in the first line. Do it in numeric form to the 2nd decimal. If the R0 values do not exist, estimate one value from the range given and put the range after that value with a comma separating them. This should be one line. If you cannot find a range, print “NaN.”

In the following two lines, put the links to the specific articles where the information came from. Each source should have its own line. Each URL should be copy-pasted of the journal article where the information is found. After that, end the response. Remember, these links are on the two lines AFTER the numbers given in the earlier paragraph. 

Double-check your result. In the following line, output either “true” if both the links relate to the average R0 value of the HIV virus. If not, output “false”.
